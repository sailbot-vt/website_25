# Website for Virginia Tech's Sailbot team

This website is written in raw HTML, JS, and CSS.

## File Layout

-   `index.html`: Main **about** page
-   `app` folder: Contains the html source for all the auxiliary pages (e.g., meet the team)
-   `css` folder: Styling for the overall website as well as specific styles for each subpage
-   `js` folder: JavaScript source for each of the pages

## Running for Development

### VS Code

Use the live server plugin and open the folder with it

### Python

Run `python -m http.server` in this folder. You might need to use `python3` instead of `python` on Linux/MacOS.
